- 👋 Hi, I’m @flibbit1582
- 👀 I’m interested in GENETICS/GENOMICS: neurodevelopmental conditions like autism; evolutionary biology; hereditary connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndromes; fragile X premutation; brain evolution; punctuated equilibria (PE)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning linux, python, and sqlite
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving autism and/or genome evolution, esp. relating to PE
